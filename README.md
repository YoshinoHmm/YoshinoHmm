### About me:

I'm a guy based in Milan, my passion for coding started in high school when I printed for the first time a rhombus of stars in C, creating something and immediatly seeing it taking life was mindblowing for me.
I love programming in Flutter and in React, I consider my self a very creative and patient guy but I do more than coding!
In the free time I play videogames, play the piano, read books and I love walking my dog around(his name is :waffle:).
I thrive to be a better version of my self everyday.

### My dream:
*Freedom*
